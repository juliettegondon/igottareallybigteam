## MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

This command line application uses node, inquirer, and MySQL to explore a database that houses information on the employees of a company, their roles, and the departments they belong to. Within the command line

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles


I used the basic concept of making a CRUD functionality - CRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE. These concepts can be used for data manipulation in MySQL databases.
